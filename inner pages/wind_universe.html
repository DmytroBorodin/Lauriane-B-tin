						<p class="mont-header__text">
							L’École de design Nantes Atlantique was the school where I did my Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree. To complete this last one, I worked for almost ten months on my end-of-studies project and my thesis. Having lived in Brittany for most of my life and being surrounded by the sea, I chose to work on the wind and its impacts on our lives. The city that I will be studying in this research is Lesconil, a little town which is part of Plobannalec-Lesconil municipality in Brittany. I decided to work on Lesconil because it is particularly exposed to south west winds coming from the Atlantique. This end-of-studies project led me to step outside of my comfort zone, by interviewing habitants, by creating 
							design tools to better understand their knowledge in 
							face of wind, by finding experts and asking them questions, by reading a lot of articles to become imbued with my subject.

						In today’s world, storms are more and more violent, but do populations know this fact? What do they do to be resilient? How do they act when a storm is coming? And when it is hitting? My reading and interviews with experts allowed me to expose some important facts:
					</p>
					<ul class="main__list mid__width">
						<li>
							Storms are more violent because of climate change.
						</li>
						<li>
							They are very hard to forecast, hence their dangerousness.
						</li>
						<li>
							Mid latitudes (where France is located) are more exposed to violent winds.
						</li>
						<li>
							Brittany is a more exposed area because of the south west winds coming from the Atlantique, so its coastlines are very fragile and subject to erosion and flooding.
						</li>
						<li>
							Lesconil is one of the most exposed zone of Brittany (without counting the islands) because it is located in the south with no direct obstacle. Moreover, having a seasonal public increase, a lot of people need to be aware of storms and its dangers.

						Located near the sea, Lesconil is a small marina in south Finistère, in Brittany. Its main activity is tourism and for this purpose, a lot of bars and restaurants are located around the port. It also has different beaches on both sides of the port, and different promenades are available to visit the coastlines and the surrounding areas. Based on the south coastlines, Lesconil is often exposed to violent winds coming from the south west.

In Lesconil, I interviewed about twenty random persons, but also the tourist office, the Mayor of Lesconil, the town hall urbanist, the sailing center, the local bars and restaurants. I also interviewed other people outside Lesconil, to have tourists’ opinions and experts’ points of view. I created a survey for the tourists and called, mailed or interviewed in person some experts, like geographers, CNRS research workers, geologits, architects, designers and developers. After gathering all kinds of information, I sorted them and kept what was the most important. You will see below some examples of my discoveries and the conclusions that I made from them.

Hence the importance of knowing these surrounding winds which are invisible but yet can turn out to be extremely violent.

I created thirteen cards with numbers going from 0 to 12, representing the thirteen different winds, and I did the same for the name of the winds, their speeds and their consequences on sea and on land.

						<li>
							Three types of people : permanent residents, seasonal inhabitants and casual tourists. Permanent residents feel that they know the wind, but it has changed over the years and they might not be all aware of it. Seasonal inhabitants are increasing every year and most of them are less aware of the wind and its consequences.
						</li>
						<li>
							People have issues visualizing and understanding Beaufort scale, so they don’t understand the potential dangers.
						</li>
						<li>
							Bad risk culture and wrong move when people have to react during a crisis.

					<p class="mont-header__text mid__width">
						Explore, create, design, iterate on design and conceive three distinct concepts. This second phase was in the form of posters, one to summarize the phase 1 and one for each concept, and I had to conceive small models for each concept. It was also authorized to display some booklets and useful objects: I displayed my card game, a plans booklet and a technical drawing details booklet. This phase was mute, I couldn’t defend my ideas and the jury only gave ten minutes to one person, so everything had to be succinct, concise and accurate. Of course, during this second phase, I kept interviewing users and new experts, asking them their opinion on my ideas.

The idea of the leap motion comes from Stéphane Buellet, artistic director of Chevalvert that I contacted to this end. He gave me information on how it is working. In the future, a developer will need to work on the modelization.

						The refuge is made for 14 people. Usually striking during Winter, there are not so many people around in Lesconil. If it happens during Summer, the most fragile people can be moved here while the other will have to wait for the firefighter to drive them to the omnisports club few kilometers away (that is usually what they do). People will have a protocol at their disposal to show them how to use the space. I created a bathroom and a kitchenette in the former offices which are daily hidden to the public by sliding panels. Users will have everything that they need and I try to keep their intimicy with integrated curtains for the beds, customizable panel in the bathroom.
